In the later stages of the interview process with Hudl, I was tasked to complete a design challenge.

# The Challenge

The challenge was to solve some pain points of their _Hudl Technique_ mobile app.

> - Once a user has a number of videos in their library, managing those videos could be better.
>
> - Finding a specific video is difficult. For instance, if youâ€™re looking for a golf swing from two weeks ago, you might be scrolling through lots of video to find that specific one.
>
> - Thereâ€™s no notion of separating videos into groups or teams.

# Deliverables

On top of the solving the pain points, the challenge was used to demonstrate your design process, UI design, prototyping & front end coding skills.

Check out the link below with the documentation of the solution I came to. ðŸ‘‡
